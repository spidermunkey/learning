I've scanned every peice of copy, Optimized every image, while carefully considering everything I know web-design that could bring a New Image to your landing page.

After years of study, I've recently been looking for resume building projects, so naturally, when I came across your page I noticed a few things I could fix.
My process and practice isn't as established as yours, so I figured I'd spare you the details and test out what I've been learning by building this. 
I'd really like to hear your sentiments as it would greatly benifit my journey as a web developer.

[INTENTIONS]
    My intentions we're primarily to patch any inconsistencies that don't add to the message while adhering to the integrity of theme
    and direction the current design impliments.
[DETAILS]

    { Made with love! }
