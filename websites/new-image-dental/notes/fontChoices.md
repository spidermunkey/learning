Thin Serif Fonts for the about us page seemed hard to scan quickly.
Headers are in a cursive serif not allowing headers to stand out in the way they should.
There also appears to be several different faces,colors, and styles making everything and nothing stand out at the same time.
The Colors and fonts appear formal/traditional while the picture seem to imply a Friendly and Welcoming atmosphere.
